Thanks to the broad composition of the consortium, the project will blend market knowledge with advanced academic and industrial perspectives to demonstrate the production of biomethane at scale. First, the flexible conversion of low-grade feedstocks via sorption-enhanced gasification will be validated, coupled with syngas or flue gas clean-up, in a demonstrator at TRL6. Then, a second demonstrator will also validate fluidised-bed methanation of either syngas or flue gas with the dynamic addition of hydrogen at TRL6, before both technologies are integrated into a third demonstrator to produce biomethane at scale and reach TRL7. Together, such developments work toward reaching the impacts of the work programme and lead to relevant changes in action and practice via two well-defined impact pathways (“technological development and adoption”, and “enhancing capacity”) that will ultimately help strengthen the European scientific leadership for the development of a highly competitive renewable gas industry, widen the technology portfolio of biomethane production technologies, and improve citizen well-being via reduced climate and social risks.","HORIZON.2.5 - Climate, Energy and Mobility",engineering and technologychemical engineeringchemical process engineeringengineering and technologyenvironmental engineeringenergy and fuelssocial scienceseconomics and businesseconomicssustainable economyagricultural sciencesagricultural biotechnologybiomass,HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-03,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101084148,Partner,,AlphaSYNT GmbH,Switzerland,"€ 0,00",,www.linkedin.com/company/hyield-project,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biogas upgrading to biomethane is the process where CO2 and other undesired components present in raw biogas, such as H2S, are removed.  Cleaning and upgrading biogas makes 30% of the total costs of the final biomethane product or even more in small scale biomethane production. Current physical/chemical technologies are expensive, energy intensive and are not designed for small-scale (<200Nm3/h raw biogas), with operational and investment costs increasing exponentially in low production scenarios. This hinders the widespread production and use of biomethane.  Trovant Technology is addressing this limitation with its UBI technology. UBI is a simple, cost effective biogas upgrading technology, based on biological processes, and specifically designed for small scale. It reduces energy requirements and operating costs. In addition, it captures and stores the CO2 removed from the biogas in the form of biomass, which is readily available for new biogas generation. UBI holds the potential to disrupt de-localized biomethane production making it economically feasible in scenarios where it is not considered an option nowadays.  Our preliminary market data show that Europe dominates the biomethane market, concentrating 75% of the global business. UBI will compete in the biogas upgrading equipment market, which is expected to reach 1,200 Million US$ by 2024. The development of this technology to market is aligned with Trovant’s strategy for growth and consolidation as a leader in the biomethane sector.  As a next step, we will carry out a solid feasibility study covering all the aspects required prior to market launch: detailed analysis of the technical development needed, in-depth commercial feasibility study including a detailed market assessment; and a thorough financial plan covering all the following stages.",H2020-EU.2.3. - INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP - Innovation In SMEs,engineering and technologyenvironmental engineeringenergy and fuelsagricultural sciencesagricultural biotechnologybiomass,H2020-EIC-SMEInst-2018-2020,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/886415,coordinator,,TROVANT TECHNOLOGY SL,Spain,"€ 50 000,00",,https://trovant.es/,José Manuel Estrada Pérez,CEO & Co-Founder,jose@trovanttech.com,,linkedin.com/in/estradajm,,SGI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of gasification process development and feedstock supply chain optimization will lead to significant cost reductions that allow lowering biomethane production costs by more than 30% compared to state-of-the-art biomass-to-SNG technologies. The target is at medium-scale conversion plants, which allows the use of local biomass residues and biogenic wastes without heavy transport logistics. The key innovative technology of FlexSNG is the flexible gasification process that can switch between two operation modes according to price signals and market demand: 1) co-production of biomethane, biochar and heat, and 2) maximised production of biomethane and heat.  The produced biomethane can be readily injected into the existing gas infrastructure for distribution in the transport sector, heat/power production, industries and households. The co-produced biochar can be used to displace fossil fuels in energy production and industry or in material applications.

The FlexSNG concept is based on the European partners advanced technologies in the field of oxygen production, gasification and gas clean-up and methanation. The innovative key enabling technologies will be developed and validated to TRL5. The Canadian partners bring their expertise in feedstock supply chain management, modelling and optimization of integrated biorefinery concepts, and the Canadian perspective into the project.

The combination of gasification process development and feedstock supply chain optimization will lead to significant cost reductions that allow lowering biomethane production costs by more than 30% compared to state-of-the-art biomass-to-SNG technologies. The target is at medium-scale conversion plants, which allows the use of local biomass residues and biogenic wastes without heavy transport logistics. The key innovative technology of FlexSNG is the flexible gasification process that can switch between two operation modes according to price signals and market demand: 1) co-production of biomethane, biochar and heat, and 2) maximised production of biomethane and heat.  The produced biomethane can be readily injected into the existing gas infrastructure for distribution in the transport sector, heat/power production, industries and households. The co-produced biochar can be used to displace fossil fuels in energy production and industry or in material applications.

The FlexSNG concept is based on the European partners advanced technologies in the field of oxygen production, gasification and gas clean-up and methanation.

To do so, METHAREN is providing improvements beyond the state-of-the art along four main axes related to: i) the biogas plant efficiency; ii) flexibility and energy management for RES integration; iii) the circularity approach for sustainable production and iv) innovative business models and adapted policies. The consortium will use the results of the engineering specifications (WP1) to develop the technologies related to the gasification plant (WP2), the methanation plant (WP3) and the development of the circularity (WP4) in the various processes as METHAREN will reuse water, O2 from the electrolysis, and heat to foster overall efficiency and sustainability.

The project production routes cover one or a combination of the following production pathways: thermochemical, biochemical, electrochemical, and biological. As a starting point, four demonstration plants use conventional anaerobic digestion (AD), and one uses conventional gasification. In the BIOMETHAVERSE demonstrators, CO2 effluents from AD or gasification and other intermediate products are combined with renewable hydrogen or renewable electricity directly to increase the overall biomethane yield. All demonstrated production routes go beyond conventional technologies, with a circular approach for energy and material, while aiming at reducing the overall biomethane production costs and increasing the biomethane production.

Eco ice Kälte GmbH develops technologies to exploit this attractive market potential, to generate significant growth and with this contribute to achieving the climate targets. One very promising approach results from the globally rising use of LNG as energy source, since a huge cold capacity at -162°C is stored in LNG, which is hitherto completely wasted during the regasification by heat exchange with ambient air or sea water at port terminals and LNG end user’s sites, respectively. Eco ice has developed and patented an innovative technology (TRL6) in various output classes to recover this highly valuable cold capacity without additional electrical power or gas consumption and provide it very cost-efficiently to the market. The Eco ice technology has the potential, without any self-consumption of natural gas, to create electrical power savings of 5.000 MW, i.e. to replace the fossil fuels for several large power stations. The cold market is increasingly looking for such cost-efficient and eco-friendly alternatives, as confirmed by customer feedback. Even in a conservative business scenario, which assumes a technology conversion rate of only 5%, a profitable short term growth up to a high two digit million € revenue value can be expected, as confirmed by ongoing negotiations with potential launching customers and business partners.

Towards that direction, LNG and Bio-LNG are expected to play a pivotal role in Europe’s comprehensive renewable fuel strategy for the transition to a low-carbon transport sector. Micro (Bio) LNG (production capacity 0.1-30 tons/day) refers to its direct use of (Bio) LNG in its liquid form as a transport fuel, contrary to its traditional regasification and subsequent introduction into the gas grid. Nevertheless, currently liquefaction is part of an integrated big scale distribution system, taking place in large scale facilities. This kind of facilities is highly CAPEX intensive, require long realization time (up to 72 months) and are only profitable at large scale (min. 2000 Nm3/h inlet gas flow). Thus, the market demands small liquefaction systems able to fulfil the gap among big producers and small consumers. Current competitors (mainly EU based) offer different single stage liquefaction solutions which result either to lower conversion efficiencies, higher energy consumption or require considerable higher inlet gas flow (>500 Nm3/h) and use of consumables. We provide a proprietary Micro Liquefaction Unit - MLU250 - able to treat methane streams for producing LNG as clean fuel for transportation with the following key advantages over Micro-Liquefaction systems using natural cooling media: - Cost-efficiency: “Plug and play”, modularized set up with 25% lower investment needs and accelerated construction schedules. - Energy efficiency: Low energy use for feedgas liquefaction without liquid N2 use, being from 7% up to 64% more efficient than alternatives. - Operators can easily add capacity up to 25 tons/d with small modular units (250 Nm3/h). - Remote accessibility: Enables monetization of small (bio)gas plants, impossible until now.",H2020-EU.2.3. - INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP - Innovation In SMEs,EIC-SMEInst-2018-2020 - SME instrument,H2020-EIC-SMEInst-2018-2020,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/855407,coordinator,,LIQAL BV,Netherlands,"€ 50 000,00","(25) LIQAL, a DFS company: Overview | LinkedIn",https://www.liqal.com/,Guus Couvée,Mechanical Engineer,guuscouvee@madern.com,,linkedin.com/in/guus-couvée,he works in Madern company,SGI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Guide investment decisions in wind energy is a complex as it involves various factors to monitor or assess such as energy production, maintenance, investment framework and characteristics of the wind farm. In order to tackle those different factors, a team of 14 partners have united to create a Digital Twin that seamlessly integrates and considers all these factors.

The new energy source could be employed both as a small mobile system or alternatively as a stand-alone heat and electricity generator.
Hydrogen-Metal Energy (HME) is gained when hydrogen reacts with some metals under slightly increased temperature and pressure. First experiments have shown that the total heat energy produced exceeds by many orders of magnitude the chemical energy and strongly depends on applied active metallic materials and gas conditions in special reactors. Furthermore, accelerator experiments performed at higher energies of hydrogen isotopes have shown that the reaction rates can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude due to so-called electron screening effect if metallic samples with special nanostructures or crystal lattice defects are utilized.
Thus, the main objectives of our proposal are to elaborate a comprehensive theory of HME phenomena and optimize the choice of the best materials for energy production in hydrogen-metal systems by combining accelerator and gas-loading experiments and to improve the reactors design leading to higher and stable energy production. We plan to construct a new compact reactor to test the HME technology during the long-term experiments and increase its technology readiness level.
The proposed solutions have a potential to be a breakthrough for the power supply industry and present a solution for a carbon-free technology contributing to the climate and natural environment protection.

The new energy source could be employed both as a small mobile system or alternatively as a stand-alone heat and electricity generator.
Hydrogen-Metal Energy (HME) is gained when hydrogen reacts with some metals under slightly increased temperature and pressure. First experiments have shown that the total heat energy produced exceeds by many orders of magnitude the chemical energy and strongly depends on applied active metallic materials and gas conditions in special reactors. Furthermore, accelerator experiments performed at higher energies of hydrogen isotopes have shown that the reaction rates can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude due to so-called electron screening effect if metallic samples with special nanostructures or crystal lattice defects are utilized.
Thus, the main objectives of our proposal are to elaborate a comprehensive theory of HME phenomena and optimize the choice of the best materials for energy production in hydrogen-metal systems by combining accelerator and gas-loading experiments and to improve the reactors design leading to higher and stable energy production.

Then, we enhance selected livestock farmers business and technical capacity by providing them with a series of demand-driven financial, business, and technical support services and organising dedicated capacity-building seminars. In parallel, we develop an Engagement Platform hosting tools that facilitate collaboration and knowledge exchange among industry actors and provide credible estimations of each farms biogas potential, prospect profits, environmental and social impacts. Also, we improve the societal acceptance of biogas facilities amongst citizens by 25% (or above) through well-tailored awareness-raising campaigns. At the same time, we trigger the development of an enabling environment for the market uptake of biogas by formulating relevant policy recommendations and widely disseminating them to more than 60 policymakers. Finally, a monitoring and evaluation framework evaluates the performance and impact of all the above, providing us with the intel required to catalyse mutual learning across regions and contribute to creating a guide for replicating our results. Therefore, we expect a power output of 30 MWel by our supported cases / projects, leading to an increased share of renewable energy in the final energy consumption in the target countries and ultimately, saving 270,000tn CO2 and 330,000tn CO2-eq from manure management per year.","HORIZON.2.5 - Climate, Energy and Mobility",HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-02-03 - Market Uptake Measures of renewable energy systems,HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-02,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101075659,Participant,,EUROPEAN DAIRY FARMERS E.V.,Germany,"€ 90 937,50",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saving 5% of fuel triples freight operators’ net margins and saves 6 tonnes of CO2 annually per truck. Knowing that one third of the fuel introduced in a thermal engine is lost as waste heat in exhaust gases, harvesting this huge quantity of heat to create additional energy represents an untapped opportunity to save fuel. EXOES wants to seize this unique business opportunity.

During 7 years of R&D, EXOES developed the most strategic component of a waste heat recovery system (ORC): the expander. Branded EVE® (for Energy Via Exhaust), this very innovative TRL6 expansion machine was tested in representative environments labs by major truck manufacturers and worldwide Tier 1s.

Such tests revealed an outstanding 5% fuel-consumption reduction (25% higher than competitors), what offers to the freight operators a payback period of less than 2 years. EVE® also allows truck manufacturers and Tier 1s to generate new revenues and margins. Thanks to its compatibility with any single truck platform, EVE® reduces their investment risks. With these advantages on its competitors, EXOES can target the worldwide heavy commercial vehicles segment.

EXOES needs now to achieve a 5% fuel consumption reduction under real road tests via the DEMOTRUCK, to prepare the industrialisation of the EVE® expander in a design-to-cost approach, to design the manufacturing plant for key sub-components and to assess the maintenance interval (more than 1,000 hours targeted). These are prerequisites before signing the first licencing agreement with a Tier 1. Preparing the international replication in addition summarise the TORC objectives that will make from EXOES the global leader in ORC systems with more than 230,000 EVE units installed on trucks. By 2022, the company will have created more than 210 jobs and generated a cumulative turnover of € 56 m.","H2020-EU.3.4. - SOCIETAL CHALLENGES - Smart, Green And Integrated Transport",SMEInst-10-2016-2017 - Small business innovation research for Transport and Smart Cities Mobility,H2020-SMEInst-2016-2017,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/733460,coordinator,,EXOES,France,"€ 2 134 132,88",,https://exoes.com/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the context of urgent transition towards carbon-free energy, natural gas is greener than coal or oil, and carbon-neutral sources like biogas or renewable energy power-to-gas arise as promising options. At the same time, decentralized production presents advantages as heat is not wasted and there is no loss in the electricity transportation. Integrated into smart grids, decentralized productions increases the global efficiency of the energy production. FLAMINCO is an ultra-efficient gas heat pump consisting of an innovative micro combined heat and power –micro CHP- unit, a state-of-the-art heat pump and a condensing water boiler. It may be powered with natural gas, biogas or H2 and gas mixtures. It provides up to 135 kWth. A smart control system makes the three involved technologies always work in the most cost-efficient way, ending with a yearly average efficiency of 160%. This system is ready for integration into smart grids and considers temporary costs and carbon intensity of electricity to decide the working mode. FLAMINCO targets 15-20 apartment buildings. End-users may reduce gas use by 30%, what immediately translates into economic savings (4,600 €/yr) and CO2 reduction with a fast payback of just 4 years. Maintenance costs will also be much lower than other micro-CHP technologies based on combustion engines or fuel cells.
We are MITIS, a Belgian high-tech start-up committed to the development of efficient and clean micro CHP systems. After having launched an outstanding heat exchanger and an innovative flameless combustion chamber, we are developing FLAMINCO. This will be our flagship and first mass market product. FLAMINCO will foster our business (we estimate 72.2M€ turnover in the 8th year of commercialization and 14 new jobs in the company (to add up to many other indirect jobs).",H2020-EU.2.3. - INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP - Innovation In SMEs,EIC-SMEInst-2018-2020 - SME instrument,H2020-EIC-SMEInst-2018-2020,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/946903,coordinator,,MITIS,Belgium,"€ 1 346 722,13",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ORC-PLUS is in the spectrum of “large scale prototype to pre-commercial scale demonstration”. The technology proposed is based on a solar field, using a thermal oil as Heat Transfer Fluid and ORC power unit coupled with an innovative TES. Experimental demonstration of two different industrial prototypes of TES systems will be performed in relevant environment (TRL 6). For each prototype, a simulation model of the pilot processes will be developed, with prototypes of TES systems. The models will be optimized on the basis of the characteristics of the site and power load, to determine conditions and relevant parameters of the real scenarios for each application and to select the TES technology best fitting the needs of the targeted sector. Final result will be an industrial pilot plant used to validate the technology in a real operational environment and to demonstrate its feasibility (TLR7). Validation includes an analysis of the techno-economic viability and environmental impact, and of the replicability of the pilot plant final design.

The software will be usable from tablets and AR glasses by touch gesture and hand gesture respectively. The software will blend holograms with the real world manufacturing equipment. Such holograms will be powered with the unique physical and machine learning (ML) models developed and validated experimentally in my ERC CoG ARTISTIC project and which can predict the impact of manufacturing parameters on the final electrode properties. By interacting with the holograms and without the need of programming skills, a user can in real-time create databases from her/his ongoing experiments, launch computations for analysis of experimental results, or request ML predictions about the impact of her/his intended formulation and manufacturing process on the electrode properties. She/he can also use the software to analyze possible deviations between the experimental results and the predictions to identify more easily factors that could explain unexpected experimental results. The prototype will be developed by accounting for the users' needs and from the observation of work situations. Once developed, we will perform tests and demonstrations to assess the software usability and ergonomics for its improvement while used in real situations. They will be carried out in the battery manufacturing platform of our laboratory and in companies and in institutes which already manifested interest in our proof of concept. The assessments will permit improving the software to ensure its wide acceptance.

environment. Two years later VISCOPIC developed to one of the most innovative and promising Augmented Reality
companies in the world with over a dozen won awards. Companies worldwide are concerned with the digitalisation and thus
faced with the challenge of working effectively with the resulting data volumes. Always having the right information at the
right place is the key to increased efficiency. Augmented Reality (AR) will play a major role in future business. But for most
companies, the implementation of AR is associated with a large financial investment. To lower the entry barrier for
companies being interested in AR, VISCOPIC offers with VISCOPIC Pins a simple and versatile AR solution for small and
large companies alike. The accessible AR tool makes it easy to learn how to create AR content within an hour - without any
previous knowledge. In addition to individual information, multistep instructions can also be created in just a few minutes.
Especially the manufacturing industry is highly interested in the increased efficiency and flexibility, that can be achieved by
implementing good AR applications. Since VISCOPIC started their business with AR use-case consulting and custom AR
software, they are now able to provide a holistic service and an accessible solution for AR content creation. But for most
cases an accompanying consultation will not be necessary since VISCOPIC Pins is highly intuitive. This could be achieved
by collaborating with many pilot customers (such as Audi, Deutsche Bahn Netz, BMW, VW, TetraPak, Viessmann and
more). Hempleton Partners prognoses the market for AR to explode in the next four years and grow worldwide with a CAGR
of 85 % to a market size of around € 140 billion by 2022.",H2020-EU.2.3. - INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP - Innovation In SMEs,EIC-SMEInst-2018-2020 - SME instrument,H2020-EIC-SMEInst-2018-2020,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/878239,coordinator,,VISCOPIC GMBH,Germany,"€ 50 000,00",,https://www.teamviewer.com/en/special/acquisitions/#Viscopic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For that, we need XR systems that are not just innovative and functionally complex, but also provide an experience that: satisfies the goals and needs of the user, is in compliance with the social context in which the system is being used, and is transparent, safe, secure, explainable and is trusted by the user. However, current generations of XR systems fail to provide the XR experience they were envisioned for since state-of-the-art models and technologies of XR systems fail to ensure full-fledged social acceptance. A truly XR experience requires a major paradigm shift in the way XR systems are designed, implemented, deployed and consumed. The SERMAS project will develop innovative, formal and systematic methodologies and technologies to model, develop, analyze, test and user-study socially-acceptable XR systems. This will be achieved by pursuing the following four main objectives: 1. Follow an inter-disciplinary, multi-sectorial, case-study-driven, scientific and technological methodology to implement the SERMAS Toolkit, a set of methods and tools that will greatly simplify the design, development, deployment, and management of socially-acceptable XR systems. 2. Apply the Toolkit to industrial case studies drawn from real-world application scenarios, thus paving the way to transferring project results to industrial practice. This will be possible through the active participation in the consortium of the developers of mass-use industrial XR applications. 3.
